Until now the radiance field content was more an interactive demo, lets get that presentation ready by using flutter deck and define multiple steps:
1.  cubes on, rays on, selectedRay center,sensor invisible, ui invisible, ray samples invisible. default zoom more in (we render in FHD and most of the screen should be the cube), now animate yaw using motor (check other slides for examples), this animation should be fairly small.
1. next step should be turn on sensor (quarter of the screen aligned bottom left)
2. next step should be turning of the rays
3. next step should be turning of the voxel cubes
4. next step is showing ray samples 
5. last step is stopping the animation.
